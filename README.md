# Binary Clock 2
A successor to my very first electronics project i made when I was 16y old: A Binary Clock using only discrete logic (4000/74HC series)
Re-imagined using the skills I learned over time to turn it from a barely working beginner's project. To something I honestly could sell as a Soldering Kit.
Complete with fully worked out Power design that can safely be run off a Li-Ion Battery.


For more information. Please visit the Hackaday IO journal that is being written alongside this project that goes into depth on the reverse engineering of the original and iterating on its design:

# NOTE ON PCB Layout:
This project is designed to be a little more artistic in appearance with the PCB visible to the outside world.
As such the PCB is intended to be made using a transparent Solder-mask that renders the copper visible. With the Front side lacking a Copper-pour and using rounded traces.
Please refer to OSH-Park's "After Dark" service for examples on how such PCBs tend to look.

# Current Status:
Still in mid Layout. Though should be ready for having its first set built once I finish it. Trying to figure out what to do with the Blank spot on the front in regards of copper. Maybe A Image of some kind?
